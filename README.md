# React Authentication App
This is a front-end application built with React.js that provides a user interface for an authentication service. 
The authentication service is built with Java and Spring Boot and provides functionality for user registration, login, and password reset.
The React app communicates with the authentication service using RESTful API calls.

### Live Demo
A live demo of the application is available at https://auth.danials.space/. 
You can create an account and try out the authentication features.
